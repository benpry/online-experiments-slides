# Running experiments online

# The plan

1. Overview of running online experiments
2. Prolific
3. Implementing experiments in Qualtrics / JsPsych
4. Data import in R, Python

# Online experiments

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">

<div>

Equal parts amazing and infuriating

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Online experiments are fast and conveneint!
  - I've gathered ~400 people worth of data in a single day
- They're (maybe) more representative than university students
- But you need to take some extra steps to ensure data quality
- Some paradigms (e.g. eye-tracking, brain stuff) don't work online

# Recruiting people

So where do you get people to do your study?

We recruit people on *crowd-working platforms*.

<v-clicks depth="2">

The two big ones are Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific.

Prolific is the most popular among psychologists these days

</v-clicks>

```

<v-clicks>

Anyone can sign up and complete surveys for pay. 

Anyone can pay people to do surveys on Prolific.

You can post a study and choose who it gets shown to based on location, demographics, etc.

Let's take a look at the interface!

# Ben's Prolific tips and tricks

<div class="h-4" />

<v-clicks>

- Performance-dependent bonus payments can be useful to motivate participants (you can pay them in bulk too!)
- Checking "microphone required" can help to deter bots (even if your study doesn't actually require a microphone)
- Filter participants based on number of completions and approval rate (>=98%)
- Don't reject people. Request return if they didn't complete the task.

# The experiment part

<div class="h-4" />

So how do you actually make an experiment to send people to?

<v-clicks>

There are plenty of options, but we're going to cover two:

- Qualtrics
- JsPsych

</v-clicks>

# Qualtrics

<div class="h-4" />

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

<div>

<v-clicks>

- Qualtrics is a popular platform for making surveys
- It uses a simple drag-and-drop interface 
- There's a lot of more advanced functionality available (e.g writing arbitrary javascript)

</v-clicks>

# Qualtrics tutorial

<div class="text-2xl">
Do people prefer cats or dogs? Let's make a quick survey to find out!

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

<div>

<div class="h-4" />

<v-clicks>

- a framework for making experiments using javascript
- free and open source
- makes it easier to use version control, share your experiment with others, etc.
- if you know some programming, i would recommend using jspsych for simple experiments.

# Considerations when using JsPsych

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

<div>

<span v-click>Where will I host my experiment?</span>

<v-clicks>

- JsPsych experiments are *static*, meaning they contain only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs in the participant's browser.
- Lots of websites let you host static files for free. GitHub Pages is a simple option.

</v-clicks>

<img v-after src="https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GitHub-Logo-700x394.png" />

</div>

<div>

<span v-click>Where will I save my data?</span>

<v-clicks>

- Because the experiment is static, you need to set up somewhere for the data to go.
- There are a few services that let you save data, including cognition.run and proliferate.
- If your lab runs JsPsych experiments, ask your labmates what they use!

# Tips for making good experiments

<div class="h-4" />

<v-clicks>

- People like progress bars and they're easy to implement in Qualtrics and JsPsych
- Comprehension and/or attention checks are often a good idea
- Think about accessibility: if color is important to your task, see if you can use a colorblind-friendly palette.
- Get your labmates / friends to test your experiment before posting it.

</v-clicks>

# Getting the data

<div class="h-4" />

If you ran your study on Qualtrics, you can download it as a csv.


<img v-click class="absolute top-50 left-0" src="./assets/qualtrics-export.png" />

<img v-click class="absolute top-20 left-60 w-100" src="./assets/qualtrics-more-options.png" />


---

# You can load the data easily with QualtRics

<div class="flex justify-center">
<div>
<img src="./assets/qualtRics-R.png" class="w-150" />
There's also a Python package called QualtricsAPI.
</div>
</div>

# JsPsych â€“ solutions vary

<div class="h-4" />

You can usually click a button to download the data as a csv. Then you can into Python/R.
